# <#Talent-Tracker>

## Description

The motivation for this project, was to create a user friendly application that allows the users to preform various actions on the different employees, roles and departments in their company. The user can use the "View all ..." commands, to display all already-existing data in each category (employee, roles, and departments). The "Add ..." commands will allow the user to add a new employee, role or department. When selecting the add commands, the user will be prompted with questions needed to create a new item, depending on which category they are adding to. Lastly, there is an "Update employee roles" command that allows the user to update any existing employees roles, to allow the user to easily reflect promotions or department changes. Throughout the making of this application, I was able to better understand how the use of multiple classes can be used to define different properties and methods that can be reused throughout my application, promoting code reusability and maintainability. I also was able to get experience creating and using a database to organze and store my data.

Step 2: npm run start

## Usage

Talent-Tracker Demo Video: 

-User must first run "npm install" and "npm run start" to allow the first prompt to be presented. 

-This first prompt will give the user options on what action they would like to perform with the Talent-Tracker.

-The different actions that can be performed with the Talent-Tracker include: View all employees, Add employee, Update employees role, View all roles, Add role, View all departments, Add department, and Quit.

-The "View all roles", "View all deparatments" and "View all employees" actions will display the correct table of data to the user, to allow them to see what data is being currently stored in the Talent-Tracker.

-The "Add employee", "Add role", and "Add department" actions allows the user to add new employees, roles, or departments to their database. When selecting an "Add ..." action, you will be prompted with the necessary questions in order to add your item, depending on which category you are adding to.

-The "Update employees role" action, will get all of the current employees in your database, to allow you to choose which employee you would like to update. Once you select an employee, you can then update their role.

-The Talent-Tracker will continue to allow you to preform these actions, until the user selects the "Quit" action. This will display a goodbye message and exit the application for the user swiftly.
