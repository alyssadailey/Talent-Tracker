## Description

Talent-Tracker is a user-friendly employee management system that allows users to view, add, and update employees, roles, and departments within a company.

Key Features:
-View All Data: Users can retrieve and display all existing employees, roles, and departments stored in the system.

-Add New Data: Users can add employees, roles, or departments by following interactive prompts that guide them through the process.

-Update Employee Roles: Easily update an employee's role or department, reflecting promotions and internal changes.

-Interactive CLI Experience: The application operates entirely within the command line interface (CLI) for quick and efficient data management.

-Database Integration: Talent-Tracker uses a structured database to store and manage employee data, ensuring easy access and modification.

This project enhanced my understanding of how multiple classes can be used to define reusable properties and methods, promoting clean, maintainable, and scalable code. Additionally, it provided hands-on experience with database creation and management to organize and store data effectively.

## Usage

Talent-Tracker Demo Video: https://www.loom.com/share/8792f69c18c0474aacae25c93e1671fd?sid=855ac26d-101b-442a-a540-d7d8b79e387d


-After the user runs "npm run start" it allowa the first prompt to be presented. 

-This first prompt will give the user options on what action they would like to perform with the Talent-Tracker.

-The different actions that can be performed with the Talent-Tracker include: View all employees, Add employee, Update employees role, View all roles, Add role, View all departments, Add department, and Quit.

-The "View all roles", "View all deparatments" and "View all employees" actions will display the correct table of data to the user, to allow them to see what data is being currently stored in the Talent-Tracker.

-The "Add employee", "Add role", and "Add department" actions allows the user to add new employees, roles, or departments to their database. When selecting an "Add ..." action, you will be prompted with the necessary questions in order to add your item, depending on which category you are adding to.

-The "Update employees role" action, will get all of the current employees in your database, to allow you to choose which employee you would like to update. Once you select an employee, you can then update their role.

-The Talent-Tracker will continue to allow you to preform these actions, until the user selects the "Quit" action. This will display a goodbye message and exit the application for the user swiftly.
